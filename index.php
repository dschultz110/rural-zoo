                    <p>
                        The Rural Zoo is located in a random, average-looking area in southern Manitoba. It is a small town with a hotel, convenience store, arena, and quarry. Being away from the densely populated city, this rural area is a natural habitat to many different animals that you are welcome to visit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our unique concept involves the free-exploration of animals around the town. This allows animals to live freely as if they were in the wild. There are no specified exhibits and visitors may view the wildlife as closely as they so choose.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our mission to keep our animals as happy as possible by creating a peaceful habitat for them to thrive. We believe animals are happiest in their natural habitats, and that includes being out of a cage. We keep all of our animals from enclosures so they can live a comfortable life as they would in the wild.

                    <h2>New Exhibits</h2>
                    <p>
                        We are excited to announce two new exhibits that will be here for a limited time only; the Canada goose and the brown bear. The Canada goose is most commonly seen in the spring and during the fall on their tripi south. Bears can be found around the area during most of the summer months.
