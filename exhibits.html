                                A Canadian's favourite animal whose arrival marks the beginning of spring. These large birds land in Rural's quarry every year on way back up north. <span class="announcement">Here for a limited time only!</span>

                            <p>
                                Commonly seen in the bushy areas of the quarry, the bear can be found roaming now that spring has come. We do not recommend getting close if you spot a bear, especially the cubs. <span class="announcement">These large mammals will be here until the fall.</span>
                            </p>

                                Known for being habitually dumb and sporadic, deer can be commonly seen meandering around the town or running into fences. While deer are not an agressive species, they prefer to stay clear of human contact. Approach at your own risk.

                                Bunnies are very timid animals that are seen quite frequently in Rural. These herbivores are not fond of company, but might approach if you offer them some snacks. They are very cute and not dangerous, we rate them 10/10.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <h4>Weasel</h4>

                            <p>
                                These critters are less commonly seen roaming the town. Weasels are small and quick and like hiding in the bushes and fields around the area.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <h4>Domestic Cat</h4>

                                Cats are an animal you will most likely see when you visit Rural. Many of the town's citizens keep cats as pets and let them wander freely. There is also a small amount of strays that are always happy to receive some pats.

                            <h4>Lynx</h4>

                            <p>
                                Lynx have been rarely sighted in Rural in the past. The animals tend to stay inside the less-populated areas of the quarry. These animals are known for their pointy ears and large paws. Approach a lynx at your own risk.
